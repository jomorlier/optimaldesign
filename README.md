Content:



	1.	Introduction to Optimization for a more sustainable aviation
		Fundamental concepts: definition of an optimization problem, objective functions, and constraints.
		Types of optimization: linear, nonlinear, convex, non-convex.
		Principles of Multi-objective and Multidisciplinary Optimization for Engineers.
	2.	Gradient-Based Optimization Methods
		Basic gradient descent.
  		Augemented Lagrangian and penalty method.
  		Sensitivity analysis using autograd.
		Constraint management: Lagrange multipliers method, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP).
	3.	Eco-Selection of Materials
		Introduction to eco-design and environmental criteria.
		Multiobjective analysis tools: performance indices, criteria weighting.
	4.	Topology Optimization of Structures
