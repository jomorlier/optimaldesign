# Optimal Design
Optimal Design with applications in Aerospace


	1.	Introduction to Optimization
	•	Fundamental concepts: definition of an optimization problem, objective functions, and constraints.
	•	Types of optimization: linear, nonlinear, convex, non-convex.
	•	Principles of Multi-objective and Multidisciplinary Optimization for Engineers.
	2.	Gradient-Based Optimization Methods
	•	Basic gradient descent.

	•	Constraint management: Lagrange multipliers method, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP).
	3.	Eco-Selection of Materials
	•	Introduction to eco-design and environmental criteria.
	•	Multi-criteria analysis tools: performance indices, criteria weighting.
	4.	Topology Optimization of Structures
	•	Basics of topology design: material density and sensitivity functions.
	•	Topology algorithms: SIMP method (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization).
	5.	Applications in Aerospace Engineering
	•	Optimization of aerostructures in a multidisciplinary context (PROJECT).
